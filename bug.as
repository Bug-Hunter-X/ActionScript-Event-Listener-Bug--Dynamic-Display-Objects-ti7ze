An uncommon ActionScript bug involves unexpected behavior when dealing with dynamically created display objects and their event listeners.  Specifically, if you create a display object (e.g., using `new Sprite()`) and attach an event listener to it, then remove the display object from the display list and later add it back, the event listener might not function as expected.  This happens because the event listener's target object may lose its reference, or garbage collection might interfere.
